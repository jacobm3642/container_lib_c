This is just a basic implementation of container datastructs so I can use it in other projects

Every datastruct with have these operations
Insert, Remove, Sequential access, Random access, Find, Sort

When you init a datastruct you will be able to passed a function ptr to a allocator and a sorting function
when NULL is pass it will use malloc/free and quicksort
